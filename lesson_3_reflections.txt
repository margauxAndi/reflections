When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  Remote repository with be useful when I want to share my codes to others or I want to store them in Github.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there might be conflict in the files and could cause your current work to be overwritten or deleted.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of a repository in GitHub with links to the original repository.  Clones are copies made from GitHub to a local location.  Branches are named commits.  

	Fork is used when you want to modify codes/files from another repository without affecting the original repository.  Clone is ussed to copy codes that will later on be updated.  Branch is used to name a commit to make it easier to remember. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So that when the developer is offline he may still be able to merge his work, when he's ready to merge them, with the remote latest state.
