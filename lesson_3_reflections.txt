When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  Remote repository with be useful when I want to share my codes to others or I want to store them in Github.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there might be conflict in the files and could cause your current work to be overwritten or deleted.
